Google changes its algorithms fequently to ensure organic discovery of websites. Sites
can discover patterns and share among themselves what is getting them hits, often for
a price - consultants. Key words on own website will help get some hits, but it seems
that there is a bigger weight on other website linking to yours. Popularity generates
populairy.

If we go by these [findings](https://moz.com/blog/5-surprising-seo-test-results), search
engine operators have already found out a few methods. Turns out that having 'ghost text,'
paragraphs that are on the website but not displayed, does not affect the search engine.
Adding more headers with key words also doesn't help - it is known that headers do help,
but it seems you have to pick the right one. Also turns out, catering to your intended
audience, does in fact increase traffic - British website increased traffic by 24% when
they started using "pants" instead of "trousers."

Personally, I believe that increasing website traffic should rely more on word of mouth
than anything else. Making sure that there are more people linking to your website does
more for organic growth than anything else. Small campaigns "next shipment free if you 
link us to Instagram, Reddit, and unspecified other social media" would do more.

Now for this website, we need to emphasize news. "Breaking", "News", "Announcement", and
so own should pop up in the header. But also adding more terms like that in each
individual page, ie: business has more business terms - inflation, indexes, stock,
selloff, and so on, while tech would have computer, chip, silicon, Moore's law, each
appropriate to the article.
